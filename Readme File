Hello Professor,
I think I have learnt alot in the span of this course and one of the most important tools i think has to be Git, as it is such a big part of the data science community.
In this assignment I learnt the following:
- pull requets
- creating readme  fils

I think I need more practice on this platform but I guess we all have to start somewhere.
Kindly,
Akshay
